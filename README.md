# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains solutions (or failures) for the 2021 edition of the
[**Advent of Code**][advent] in multiple languages. Each day's problem is
contained in a single file. There are no dependencies other than the standard
libraries of the respective languages.

## Running the solutions

Some of the solutions are written in compiled languages, which need to be built
before they can be run. A [**Makefile**][make] is available which provides a
consistent interface for running examples.

Run `make` to see the usage information.
